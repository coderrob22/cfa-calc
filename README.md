Chic-fil-a Calculator

This app was built using:
-html, 
-css,
-vanilla js.

This app doesn't require any special software installed to run it. 

It works best on desktop, although the mobile version is coming soon with a bug fix.

Layout:
    This is a standard calculator that only calculates cfa menu items (minus the taxes). This data was pulled during mid 2022 so prices could have gone up at the time of your use.

Enjoy!
