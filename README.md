## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This app doesn't require any special software installed to run it. This is a standard calculator that only calculates cfa menu items (minus the taxes). This data was pulled during mid 2022 so prices could have gone up at the time of your use. To use, click on the menu your heart desires to see the price! If you need to reset the screen click on the 'chic-fil-a sauce' at the bottom (we all know cfa sauce is so delicious it helps to reset our hangry moods). 

## Optimizations
*(Mobile version)*

It works best on desktop, although the mobile version is coming soon with a bug fix.
